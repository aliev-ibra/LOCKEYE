LOCKEYE
LOCKEYE is an advanced application that integrates facial recognition and liveness detection technologies to provide a secure and intelligent locking mechanism. By leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning, LOCKEYE ensures that access is granted only to authorized and live individuals, enhancing security for various applications.

Features
Facial Recognition: Utilizes landmark-based models to identify individuals based on unique facial features, allowing for accurate recognition with minimal training data.

Liveness Detection: Employs 3D convolutional neural networks to distinguish between live individuals and spoofing attempts, such as photographs or masks, ensuring that only real, live users can gain access.

Real-Time Processing: Designed for efficient real-time analysis, providing quick and reliable authentication without significant delays.

Installation
To set up and run LOCKEYE, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/aliev-ibra/LOCKEYE.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd LOCKEYE
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
Start the Application:

Launch the application using:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
This will start the development server, and you can access the application at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Upon launching, LOCKEYE will activate the connected webcam to capture real-time video input. The system will perform the following steps:

Liveness Verification: Analyze the video feed to confirm the presence of a live individual.

Facial Recognition: Compare the detected face against the authorized users' database.

Access Decision: Grant or deny access based on the recognition results.

For optimal performance:

Ensure proper lighting conditions.

Position the camera at eye level.

Maintain a clear background to avoid false detections.

Configuration
LOCKEYE's behavior can be customized through the config.json file located in the root directory. Key configurable parameters include:

Recognition Threshold: Adjust the confidence level required for positive identification.

Camera Settings: Modify resolution and frame rate to suit hardware capabilities.

User Database: Update the list of authorized users with their corresponding facial data.

After making changes to the configuration, restart the application to apply the new settings.
